# Welcome to The MakerFormLab Documentation

Discover The MakerFormLab, the innovative web platform where architects and designers transform their visions with exceptional sculptural art. Access a vital online gallery of 3D CAD models, enabling you to integrate artworks from the initial design phase. This foresight means no costly building modifications later, perfect pre-installed power and lighting, and natural light that enhances the art by design. It also simplifies budgeting by including artworks from the outset, streamlining the search for elusive sculptural additions.

For artists, The MakerFormLab is your direct pipeline to architectural integration. It's a powerful point-of-sale and a secure hub for your available 3D artworks, ready to be discovered, visualized, and selected by design professionals actively looking to enhance their projects.

### Engaging with Artworks: Download, Hold, & Buy

The core of The MakerFormLab's functionality lies in the three interactive buttons on each artwork's profile page, allowing registered users to engage with pieces in different ways:

* **Download:** Instantly access the 3D CAD file for the artwork. This allows architects and designers to incorporate the model into their designs, facilitating early-stage visualization and planning.
* **Hold:** Secure an artwork exclusively for a specified period for a set cost. While an artwork is on hold, no other user can place a hold or initiate a purchase. Importantly, the CAD file remains available for download by any registered user, ensuring flexibility for design exploration.
* **Buy:** Make a firm commitment to purchase the artwork. Once bought, the artwork becomes unavailable for other users to download, hold, or buy, signifying its acquisition.
