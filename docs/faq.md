# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Welcome to The MakerFormLab FAQ. Here you'll find answers to common questions about using our platform, whether you're an architect, a designer, an artist, or just curious.

## General Questions

### Q: What is The MakerFormLab?
A: The MakerFormLab is an innovative web platform that connects architects and designers with exceptional sculptural art. It allows designers to integrate 3D CAD models of artworks directly into their projects from the initial design phase, while providing artists a direct point-of-sale and secure hub for their work.

### Q: Who can use The MakerFormLab?
A: The platform is primarily designed for three main user groups:
* **Architects & Designers:** To discover, visualize, download CAD models, hold, and purchase sculptural art.
* **Artists:** To showcase and sell their 3D sculptural artworks to design professionals.
* **Administrators:** To manage and curate the platform content and users.
Guests can browse the collection but cannot download, hold, or buy artworks without logging in.

### Q: Is there a cost to join The MakerFormLab?
A: Browse the platform is free. Specific costs may apply for artists (e.g., commission on sales) and for architects/designers (e.g., placing a hold on an artwork). Detailed pricing information will be available upon registration or within your account settings.

## For Architects & Designers

### Q: How do I download a 3D CAD model?
A: Once logged in, navigate to an artwork's profile page. You will see a "Download" button. Clicking this will instantly provide you with the 3D CAD file of the artwork.

### Q: What CAD file formats are supported for download?
A: We typically provide models in common architectural CAD formats such as .OBJ, .FBX, .STL, and .DAE. Please check the individual artwork's profile page for specific available formats.

### Q: What does "Hold" mean?
A: Placing an artwork on "Hold" secures it exclusively for you for a specified period for a set cost. During this time, no other user can place a hold or purchase that artwork. The CAD file, however, remains available for download by any registered user for design exploration.

### Q: What happens if a hold expires?
A: If a hold expires without a purchase being made, the artwork becomes immediately available again for all users to download, hold, or buy.

### Q: How do I purchase an artwork?
A: On an artwork's profile page, click the "Buy" button. You will be guided through a secure payment process. Once purchased, the artwork is marked as "Sold" and becomes unavailable to other users.

## For Artists

### Q: How do I upload my artworks?
A: After logging into your Artist account, navigate to your Artist Dashboard and click the "Upload Artwork" button. You will be prompted to provide details about your artwork (name, description, category, price) and upload high-quality images and a 3D CAD model file.

### Q: What file formats are required for artwork uploads?
A: You will need to upload:
* **Images:** High-resolution JPEG or PNG files.
* **3D CAD Model:** Common formats like .OBJ, .FBX, .STL, or .DAE are preferred. If you have a different format, please contact support to inquire about compatibility.

### Q: What happens after I upload an artwork?
A: Your submitted artwork will enter a "Pending Admin Review" status. Our administrators will review the submission for eligibility and quality. You will be notified once your artwork is approved and live, or if it requires revisions.

### Q: How are sales and holds managed?
A: The MakerFormLab handles the "Hold" and "Buy" transactions. When an artwork is sold, you will be notified, and our platform will facilitate the necessary information exchange for shipping and installation.

### Q: Do you take a commission on sales?
A: Yes, The MakerFormLab operates on a commission basis for successful sales. Specific commission rates and terms will be detailed in your Artist Agreement upon registration.
