# Uploading Artworks

Sharing your sculptural masterpieces with the architectural and design community on The MakerFormLab is a straightforward process. This guide outlines the steps to upload your artworks, including all necessary visual and 3D model files.

## The Artwork Upload Form

From your Artist Dashboard, locate and click the **"Upload Artwork"** or **"Add New Artwork"** button. This will take you to the dedicated upload form.

### Required Information:

1.  **Artwork Name:**
    * Provide a clear and descriptive title for your artwork.

2.  **Category Selection:**
    * Choose the primary category that best fits your artwork:
        * **Light:** For pieces specifically designed to incorporate various lighting elements.
        * **Form:** For freestanding sculptural artworks.
        * **Wall:** For wall murals and relief sculptures.
    * *Note: While an artwork may have elements of multiple categories, select the most dominant one.*

3.  **Detailed Description:**
    * Write a comprehensive description of your artwork. Include:
        * Inspiration and concept behind the piece.
        * Materials used (e.g., bronze, steel, mixed media, stone, wood).
        * Dimensions (Height, Width, Depth) in standard units (e.g., cm, inches).
        * Weight (if significant for installation).
        * Any specific installation requirements or recommendations (e.g., power outlets for lighting, structural considerations for wall mounting).
        * Maintenance instructions (if applicable).

4.  **Price:**
    * Enter the selling price of the artwork. Please ensure this is the final price, inclusive of any commissions or platform fees (details of which will be outlined in your Artist Agreement).

### File Uploads:

1.  **High-Quality Images:**
    * Upload multiple high-resolution images of your artwork.
    * Include a primary image that best represents the piece, along with supplementary images from different angles, showing details, or contextualizing the artwork in a space (if available).
    * **Supported Formats:** JPEG, PNG.
    * **Recommendations:** Ensure good lighting, clear focus, and accurate color representation. Aim for images that showcase the artwork's texture, scale, and form effectively.

2.  **3D CAD Model File:**
    * This is a critical component for The MakerFormLab's functionality. Upload the 3D CAD model file of your artwork.
    * **Supported Formats:** .OBJ, .FBX, .STL, .DAE, or other common architectural CAD formats (refer to our FAQ for a full list of supported formats).
    * **Importance:** This file allows architects and designers to download and integrate your artwork directly into their design software for visualization and planning, significantly increasing its adoption potential.
    * **Accuracy:** Ensure the CAD model is an accurate representation of the physical artwork's dimensions and form.
